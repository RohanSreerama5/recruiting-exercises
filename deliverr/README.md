Deliverr Inventory Allocator by Rohan Sreerama 

Hello there! 

Thank you so much for considering my application to Deliverr! I'm extremely excited to have the opportunity to work here and I hope you like my implementation! Here's how you can get set up: 

Please ensure you have Golang installed and set up on your PATH 

`Clone the deliverr directory` 

Inside the deliverr directory, 
`cd allocator` 

To test, (NOTE: If you are using VSCode, you can simply click the `run test` button) 


`go test -v` 

I've also written some driver code in main.go to test this project as a build. 
Simply run (from the root of the deliverr directory), 

`go build` 

Then, run the executable file via: 

`./deliverr`

I've tested this build numerous times and have fortunately received `PASS` every time in the Go tests. Please do inform me if you notice any discrepancies or have issues getting it to run correctly. 

How does this work? 
When an input order is given, an array of distributors that satisfy the requirements of that order is returned. This array provides not a list of distributors, but also the inventory of each selected distributor so as to provide clarity to the client. I've also included a number of test cases to ensure that the behavior of this implementation is consistent and reliable. 

I absolutely loved working on this project! I always enjoy the code-debug-code process and I look forward to making impactful contributions at Deliverr! Looking forward to hearing back soon! 

Thank you for your time and patience!
